# Haddon Community Learning Centre

Using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), and [Michael Rose](http://mademistakes.com/)'s [So Simple Theme](http://mmistakes.github.io/so-simple-theme/) as a starting point, this is the source for the [Haddon Community Learning Centre's website](http://www.haddonlearning.org.au/), or will be in the near future.

Manging the site is fairly simple - but as the site is large, it's easy to get lost. This document is your best friend.

## Management
After some searching, due to the difficulties that managing the website via a particular computer presented, and the difficulties of version management for the client, management is now done via [Prose](https://prose.io).

Prose allows you to browse all files, and make changes to it, in a near WYSIWYG environment, but not quite.

Once you have logged into Prose, you can click on files to access them.

It has *two* modes.

*Edit Mode* and *Preview Mode*.

##Edit Mode

The pencil on the upper left hand corner of the screen allow you to edit, using Markdown, though some buttons at the top of the screen can help you there.

If you wish to make a title, write the word you would like to highlight, such as:



##Preview Mode

The eye on the upper left hand corner of the screen allows you to preview the file you are working on, and see it almost as it would appear on the website.
