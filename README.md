# Haddon Community Learning Centre

Using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), and [Michael Rose](http://mademistakes.com/)'s [So Simple Theme](http://mmistakes.github.io/so-simple-theme/) as a starting point, this is the source for the [Haddon Community Learning Centre's website](http://www.haddonlearning.org.au/), or will be in the near future.

Manging the site is fairly simple - but as the site is large, it's easy to get lost. This document is your best friend.

## Management
Please see the [wiki](https://github.com/HaddonCommunityLearningCentre/HaddonCommunityLearningCentre.github.io/wiki).

** If you get an error, please contact support.**

#NEVER

Directly edit the website on GitHub.

This breaks the hooks that in place and responsible for:

* Ensuring the latest version of the website goes live.
* Versioning happens correctly, so backups exist and can be rolled back to.
* Prose continues to function correctly.
