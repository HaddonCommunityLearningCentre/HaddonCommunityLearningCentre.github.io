# Haddon Community Learning Centre

Using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), and [Michael Rose](http://mademistakes.com/)'s [So Simple Theme](http://mmistakes.github.io/so-simple-theme/) as a starting point, this is the source for the [Haddon Community Learning Centre's website](http://www.haddonlearning.org.au/), or will be in the near future.

Manging the site is fairly simple - but as the site is large, it's easy to get lost. This document is your best friend.

## Management
After some searching, due to the difficulties that managing the website via a particular computer presented, and the difficulties of version management for the client, management is now done via [Prose](https://prose.io).

Prose allows you to browse all files, and make changes to it, in a near WYSIWYG environment, but not quite.

Once you have logged into Prose, you can click on files to access them.

It has *two* modes.

*Edit Mode* and *Preview Mode*.

## Edit Mode

The pencil on the upper left hand corner of the screen allows you to edit, using Markdown, though some buttons at the top of the screen can help you there.

### Titles

If you wish to make a title, write the word you would like to highlight, such as:

```
Haddon Community Learning Centre
```

Then highlight it, using your mouse, and click the'*h2* or *h3* button, 

![h2](https://imgur.com/JP9eme3.jpg)

and it will become a title.

In *edit mode*, it will appear similar to:

```
## Haddon Community Learning Centre
```

### Links

If you wish to insert a link, simply click the joined chain at the top of the screen, and a dropdown will appear.

Fill in all three boxes (the optional *Link title* is used by search engines and screen readers, and is therefore important to fill in.)

Then click *Insert*.

The link will appear, correctly formatted, wherever you were editing.

You can use *Preview Mode* to see how it appears.

### Images

Images are handled very simply from within Prose.

However, Prose is not yet correctly set up, and so it should be avoided.

This will be modified to show you how to correctly use images, once Prose has been enabled correctly.

### General Formatting

There are buttons for *Bold* and *Italic* text, 

![Bold and Italic](https://imgur.com/iyn0nk4.jpg)

as well as *Quotes*, *Bullet points*, and *numbered lists* within Prose.

For *Bold* and *Italic* text, Prose expects you to first write whatever you wish to format, then select the text, and then finally, click the button.

For *Quotes*, *Bullet points*, and *numbered lists*, Prose expects you to click the button, and edit the text that it makes appear for you.

## Preview Mode

The eye on the upper left hand corner of the screen allows you to preview the file you are working on, and see it almost as it would appear on the website.

## Saving Changes

To save changes within Prose, pressing *Ctrl + S* saves a backup of the file you are editing, but does not make it a final copy.

For that, click the floppy disk symbol on the right hand side of the page, and enter a comment that describes the changes you have made.

It should then be reflected on the website momentarily.
