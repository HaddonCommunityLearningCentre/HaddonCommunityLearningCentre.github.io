The Haddon Community Learning Centre is an awarding winning Learn Local organization offering a range of education and training programs designed to meet your learning needs. Find out more about [Learn Local](http://www.learnlocal.org.au/).

We are a locally managed, not-for-profit community centre providing adult education opportunities for life long learning in our local community. We offer convenient, welcoming and flexible learning options in a wide variety of personal interest programs.

##What We Do

We provide the opportunity for everyone to participate in learning whatever your needs. We provide not only training for career or job requirements but also in other activities and courses to enrich your lives such as art, crafts and health and well being activities.

We provide a friendly welcoming place to meet, relax, make friends in a safe comfortable local learning environment. We also work with many other organisations to provide access to other programs and services.
